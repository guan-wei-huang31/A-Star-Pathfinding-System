# **A Star FleetFlow System**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to develop an optimized delivery management system for a local logistics company, leveraging the A* algorithm to efficiently navigate trucks across a 25x25 grid map. Each truck follows predefined routes to deliver packages across the city, with constraints on cargo capacity and volume.
---

## **Features**
- **Route Optimization:** Utilizes the A* algorithm to find the most efficient paths for three trucks operating on different routes (blue, green, and yellow).
- **Grid-Based Map:** Represents the city as a 25x25 grid with predefined paths, buildings for delivery, and open spaces.

## **Technologies Used**
-- **Algorithm:** A* algorithm for optimal pathfinding.
