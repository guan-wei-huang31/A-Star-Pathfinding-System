# **A-Star-Pathfinding-System**

## **Project Overview**
This project simulates a delivery truck routing system for a local delivery company operating in a 25x25 grid city. The company uses three trucks, each assigned to specific routes (blue, yellow, and green) to efficiently deliver packages to designated buildings.  
The system provides truck routing, route selection, cargo tracking, and dynamic pathfinding using the A* algorithm for shortest path calculations.

---

## **üì¶Features**
- **Dynamic Route Optimization:** Uses the A* algorithm to dynamically calculate the shortest diversion paths based on cargo destination, ensuring efficient delivery.
- **Multi-Route Management:** Supports multiple pre-defined routes (Blue, Green, Yellow) for different trucks, enabling adaptable transport logistics.
- **Cargo and Truck Management:** Monitors truck capacity in real-time, including weight and volume checks, to ensure optimal load distribution.
- **User-Friendly Interaction:** Interactive user input allows operators to specify shipment details (weight, volume, and destination) and receive immediate routing suggestions.

## **üöÄKey Algorithm Steps**
- **Map Population and Visualization**: 
  1. A pre-defined map grid representing possible routes and obstacles is initialized and populated with delivery routes.
  2. Visual representation of routes on a 2D grid, making it easy to verify and understand routes.
- **Cargo Input and Validation**: 
  1. Accepts user input for cargo details (weight, volume, destination).
  2. Validates cargo attributes against maximum allowable weight and volume, as well as destination constraints.
- **Route Calculation and Optimization (A Algorithm)**: 
  1. Uses the A* pathfinding algorithm to calculate the shortest route or diversion for each truck, bypassing obstacles.
  2. Calculates Euclidean distance to provide efficient pathfinding based on real-world scenarios.
- **Truck Assignment and Load Management**: 
  1. Dynamically assigns the most suitable truck based on the load and the shortest path to the destination.
  2. Updates truck's load information, including total weight, volume, and utilized capacity, to prevent overloads.
